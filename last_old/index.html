            <h4>Embedded Systems </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <br />
            <h6>An embedded system is a microprocessor-based computer hardware system with software that is designed to
                perform a dedicated function, either as an independent system or as a part of a large system. At the
                core is an integrated circuit designed to carry out computation for real-time operations.</h6>
            <p>An embedded application is software that is placed permanently inside some kind of device to perform a
                very specific set of functions. Some small embedded applications like those in a microwave oven do not
                need an operating system (OS) to control them. Other, more complex, devices like entertainment systems
                that control hundreds of different channels and need to record and play videos from a variety of
                devices, will need an OS to manage the resources of the embedded system in real time. Real Time Embedded
                Systems include things like GPS Navigation systems, industrial robots, traffic monitoring systems, smart
                phones, and smart TVs.</p>
            <p>A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small computer on a single
                metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip. A microcontroller contains one or more
                CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals</p>
        </div>

    <div class="content-card-container">
        <div class="rtos-content">
            <h4>Real Time Operating System </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <br />
            <h6>Real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system intended to serve real time application that
                process data as it comes in, mostly without buffer delay. The full form of RTOS is Real time operating
                system.

                In a RTOS, Processing time requirement are calculated in tenths of seconds increments of time. It is
                time-bound system that can be defined as fixed time constraints. In this type of system, processing must
                be done inside the specified constraints. Otherwise, the system will fail.</h6>

            <p>Many embedded systems require real-time behavior, and due to hardware resource constraints, performance
                and efficiency are top priorities. An RTOS provides the rigorous resource management and scheduling
                required to meet the demands of applications– with multitasking, threads, priority-driven preemptive
                scheduling, and fast context-switching — all essential features of an embedded real-time system.
                <br />
                An RTOS typically has a small footprint and is optimized for performance, however each RTOS must be
                customized with capabilities needed for the hardware and system it supports. From a bare-bones kernel
                configuration managing a small number of tasks, to a full-functionality RTOS managing hundreds of tasks
                and subsystems including graphics, networking, filesystem, audio and more – an RTOS should flexibly
                scale to address system requirements and resources.

            <h4>Linux </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <br />
            <h6>Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular
                platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is
                software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it
                simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without
                the operating system (OS), the software wouldn?t function.</h6>

            <p> Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source follows these key tenants:
            </p>
            <p>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</p>
            <p>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</p>
            <p>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</p>
            <p>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p>
            <p>These points are crucial to understanding the community that works together to create the Linux platform.
                Without a doubt, Linux is an operating system that is ?by the people, for the people?. These tenants are
                also a main factor in why many people choose Linux. It?s about freedom and freedom of use and freedom of
                choice.</p>

        <div class="qt-content">
            <h4>Qt </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <br />
            <h6>Qt (pronounced as "cute", not "cu-tee") is a cross-platform framework that is usually used as a
                graphical toolkit, although it is also very helpful in creating CLI applications. It runs on the three
                major desktop OSes, as well as on mobile OSes, such as Symbian, Nokia Belle, Meego Harmattan, MeeGo or
                BB10, and on embedded devices. Ports for Android (Necessitas) and iOS are also in development.</h6>

            <p> When first released, Qt used its own paint engine and controls, emulating the look of the different
                platforms it runs on when it drew its widgets. This made the porting work easier because very few
                classes in Qt really depended on the target platform; however, this occasionally led to slight
                discrepancies where that emulation was imperfect. Recent versions of Qt use the native style APIs of the
                different platforms, on platforms that have a native widget set, to query metrics and draw most
                controls, and do not suffer from such issues as often.</p>
